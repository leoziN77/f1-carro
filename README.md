# F1 Rules Explorer

An interactive, explodable 3D Formula 1 car (three.js) that explains the 2026 FIA
Formula 1 Technical Regulations part by part. The car is procedurally modelled and
deliberately generic: no team, no logos.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # static build in dist/
```

## What you can do

- **Hover** any part to highlight it, with a callout explaining its rules. **Click** to pin the callout.
- **Disassemble**: use presets (remove bodywork, remove wheels, bare chassis, power unit, exploded) or the explode slider.
- **Layers**: toggle bodywork, wings & floor, wheels, brakes & suspension, chassis, power unit, cockpit and FIA electronics.
- **Rule colours**: tint every part by who designs it (FIA single supplier, defined spec, PU, transferable, open source, team-designed).
- **X-ray** the bodywork and survival cell to see the fuel cell, battery and engine in place.
- **Dimensions**: overlay the key regulated measurements.
- **Active aero**: switch Corner Mode / Straight Mode to animate the 2026 movable wings.
- Change the **tyre compound**.
